Template for automating experiments on your own computer or on the Grace

You should run parallel instances of this script to do different configs
simultaneously.

INSTRUCTIONS: This script runs experimental trials for all conditions
specified in the configurations in lines 36 to 64. Please comment out
all items in the configurations except for those pertaining to the
trials you are running. Then, run this script from the terminal. Please
report the testing accuracy for the last epoch from each trial in the
"Task Results (Last Epoch)" sheet and upload the saved models, found in
the directory "stacknn-experiments," to the "StackNN Trained Models"
Google Drive folder.
